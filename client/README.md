# TaskTitle Component

The **TaskTitle** component is a small, reusable React UI element for displaying a task section title with a colored status indicator and an optional "add" button.

It’s perfect for use in task boards, kanban views, or anywhere you want to label a group of tasks with a color-coded tag.
